# No Boilerplate Vite
Too often have I found myself creating a React project and having to manually install Tailwind and remove the boilerplate that comes with Vite. So, I wrote a super-simple CLI tool to automatically scaffold a Vite project and pre-install tailwind.
### Installation
Note: Having `cargo`, `node` and `npm` already installed is a prerequisite.
```
cargo build --release
```
Add the created `nvb` executable in `target/release/` to path or any `bin` folder to access it globally in the terminal.
```
sudo cp target/release/nbv /usr/local/bin
```
### Usage
```
nbv demo-app --install
```
Omit `-i` or `--install` if you do not wish to download the npm packages

### Options
```
nbv --help
```

PS: This project is useless if Vite decides to add `--tailwind` and `--no-boilerplate` options. ðŸ˜”
